# AppleControl
AppleControl is a plugin for Bukkit and Spigot servers which allows you to control how many notch apples your players can have in their inventory at one time. Players can check and claim back confiscated apples at their own will. This plugin is designed with PVP in mind but can be used on any server that would like to control the use of notch apples. You can outright ban the use of notch apples by setting the maximum number to 0, keep with the default 5, or any other setup that you'd like to use. The apple claiming system is automatically disabled if it is set to 0 for obvious reasons.
